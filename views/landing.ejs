      <textarea class="default-message-field" readonly="" placeholder="Dear [SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER],

I am a [RICHMOND TEACHER, STUDENT, CITIZEN] living in your district.  I am writing to urge you to vote to terminate the memorandum of understanding between RPD and RPS and move immediately on a one-to-one replacement of school resource officers with nondisciplinary support staff positions like counselors and mental health providers.  The district’s strategic plan, DREAMS4RPS, outlines a commitment to creating a safe and loving school culture.  This cannot be fully realized should RPS continue to staff schools with police officers.  Long before the high-profile murders of unarmed Black civilians by officers and the presence of militarized police forces at peaceful protests, police interactions have been a source of trauma for students and families throughout our division.  The mere presence of an officer can trigger memories of violent events and family member removal in students.  Reliance on SROs criminalizes students and their behaviors that can and must be addressed compassionately through other means.
In addition to the termination of the MOU, I urge you to support the re-allocation of funds to hire more guidance counselors, behavior counselors, and mental health providers in our schools, implement restorative justice practices in schools across the district, and support the student leaders who are working to build a coalition to address racial disparities in RPS.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
